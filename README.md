# Welcome to 42cursus-minishell!
This repository contains a group project of the [42 school]. The task for the
two students is to write a simple shell. This project was done by [nimichi] and
[mhahnFr].

## Approach
As the first step, the input string is parsed until a delimiter such as a pipe
or an operator is reached. Then, it will be executed. After it has been
executed, the parsing continues to the next block. This goes on until the end
of the line is reached.

### Final notes
We did this project within one month. There may of course still be room for
improvements, however, this project will not be developed any further.

> As all other C projects at the [42 school], the code has to written in accordance
> with the [norm]:
> - Only 25 lines per function,
> - only 5 functions per file,
> - usage of only the allowed external functions.
